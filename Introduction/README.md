# Introduction
This should be the very first section you should learn if you want to be a Software Engineer, and it involves having a good understanding of the computer you are using, like the components that make up a computer, what operating systems are and how to easily navigate through one, how to be effective in searching what you need on the internet, and how to use a terminal. While this stuff is rather basic, and I bet most of you already know what half of this stuff is, it is still important to cover as not mastering this stuff will make learning how to code a painful process. 

## What Will Be Covered in This Section?
The material that I will be covering 

### Computer Basics
A **computer** is an (electronic) device that run instructions given by the user. Many things are a computer, including your gaming console and smartphone, and knowing the basic terminology for computer-related stuff, like the difference between hardware and software, different kinds of computers, and components that are used to make a computer, will be important if you want to be software engineer. 

### Operating System Basics
an **operating system** is piece of software that manages hardware and software resources, as well as being a common "language" between different programs that run on your computer. I will be covering the most commonly used operating systems, like *Windows*, *MacOS*, and *Linux*, go over their key differences, and how to do important stuff like checking the settings of your operating system, 

### Web Browsers & Search Engines
a **web browser** is a piece of software that displays websites, and a **search engine** is a website that searchs for websites and other content from the internet (like images or documents) based on the words you give it. In an age where there is too much information for a single person to memorize and learn, being a good software engineer involves knowing how to use the web browser and the search engine to your advantage in solving software-based problems, like how to do a certain task in a given programming language or what a given error message means. I will go over techniques involving these two things that can help you in the future, like how to use bookmarks effectively and how to optimize your searchs in a search engine. I will also go over different kinds of web browsers and search engines, especially commonly used ones like Google Chrome and the Google search engine.

### Virtual Machines
A **virtual machine** is a piece of software that simulates being a computer, allowing you to run a computer - on a computer. Virtual machines are good places to practice programming, as they allow you to run programs on different operating systems (which is important for portability) and act as a safety measure, as any problems that occur with the virtual machine will not affect your main device in any negative way. I will go over how to set up a virtual machine on any OS, from Windows to Linux, using specialized programs like *VirtualBox* or *VMWare*.

### Terminals
a **terminal** is a way of directly interacting with the computer on any operating system that involve sending special text commands. Terminals are needed if you want to become a programmer, as many important things that you will need to do as a programmer will involve using the terminal.
