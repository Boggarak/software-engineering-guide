# Boggarak's Software Engineering Guide (WIP)
This whole repository is a series of tutorials on the various things Software Engineers learn while at university. This isn't meant to replace instruction or taking software engineering classes in University, but rather contains useful resources and tutorials that can aid instruction and help someone better understand concepts from those classes. Even if you are not planning to be a software engineer, there are plenty of things here that can help you become much better programmer in general.

(NOTE: This project is currently a work-in-progress so don't expect everything to be already available and expect updates to information shown here).
